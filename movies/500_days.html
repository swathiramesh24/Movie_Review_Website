  <!--MOVIE SUMMARY-->
  <div class="plot-summary">
    <p class="title">Summary</p>
    <p>
      (500) Days of Summer is not a love story but a story about love. 
      The film follows Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a hopeless romantic who falls deeply for Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel), a free-spirited woman who does not believe in true love.
      Told in a non-linear format, the movie jumps through different phases of their 500-day relationship—showcasing moments of joy, heartbreak, and self-discovery. 
      Through this fragmented storytelling, we witness Tom’s idealized perception of Summer clash with the painful reality of their relationship.

  <!--CAST PERFORMANCE-->
  <div class="performance">
    <p class="title">Performance</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Joseph Gordon-Levitt is outstanding as Tom, portraying the highs of new love and the devastation of heartbreak with raw honesty. 
        His performance makes Tom both relatable and flawed, showing how we often see relationships through the lens of our own expectations.
      </li>
      <li>
        Zooey Deschanel, as Summer, delivers a charming yet distant performance, perfectly embodying the idea of someone who is never fully within reach. 
        Her portrayal of Summer is refreshingly realistic, making her neither a villain nor a perfect dream girl—just a person with her own desires and struggles.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <!--DIRECTION AND SCREENPLAY-->

    <p class="title">Direction & Screenplay</p>
    <p>
      Marc Webb’s direction is fresh and innovative, breaking away from traditional romantic comedy formulas. 
      The non-linear narrative keeps the audience engaged, gradually revealing the layers of Tom and Summer’s relationship.
      The use of split screens, dream sequences, and a clever soundtrack helps bring Tom’s emotions to life. 
      One of the most iconic scenes, the "Expectations vs. Reality" split-screen, brilliantly captures the crushing difference between what we want love to be and what it actually is.

      The film’s soundtrack is one of its strongest aspects, featuring artists like The Smiths, Regina Spektor, and Hall & Oates. 
      Music is not just background noise but a key element that shapes the emotions of each scene.
